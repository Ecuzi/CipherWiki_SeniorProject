# CipherWiki_Project
Informational Brochure for Data Encryption that's interactive with users. 


Data is the new oil they say, because of its importance. It needs to be well protected and always secured. In this project we will dive into the world of cryptography and cybersecurity to get a better understanding how data is encrypted and transferred all over the world. After research is complete, we will then implement an informative program that show cases the different authentication and encryption techniques used in the real world as a service.
